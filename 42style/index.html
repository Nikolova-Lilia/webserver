        <h1>Capybara</h1>
        <p>
          The capybara or greater capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) is a
          giant cavy rodent native to South America. It is the largest living
          rodent and a member of the genus Hydrochoerus. The only other extant
          member is the lesser capybara (Hydrochoerus isthmius). Its close
          relatives include guinea pigs and rock cavies, and it is more
          distantly related to the agouti, the chinchilla, and the nutria. The
          capybara inhabits savannas and dense forests, and lives near bodies of
          water. It is a highly social species and can be found in groups as
          large as 100 individuals, but usually live in groups of 10-20
          individuals. The capybara is hunted for its meat and hide and also for
          grease from its thick fatty skin.

        <h1>Guinea pig</h1>
        <p>
          The guinea pig or domestic guinea pig (Cavia porcellus), also known as
          the cavy or domestic cavy, is a species of rodent belonging to the
          genus Cavia in the family Caviidae. Breeders tend to use the name
          "cavy" for the animal, but "guinea pig" is more commonly used in
          scientific and laboratory contexts. Despite their name, guinea pigs
          are not native to Guinea, nor are they closely related to pigs. They
          originated in the Andes region of South America. Studies based on
          biochemistry and hybridization suggest they are domesticated animals
          that do not exist naturally in the wild, descendants of a closely
          related cavy species such as C. tschudii. They were originally
          domesticated as livestock for a source of meat, and are still consumed
          in some parts of the world.
